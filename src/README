Server Overview:
	It is a multithreaded desgin. In summary we have the main thread always sitting on the `accept()` call to accept incoming client connections
	and when a client connection is recieved, it's information(socket,key) is tossed into an object(WorkerInfo) and this obejct is tossed into
	a hashmap, keyed by the key the client just sent. When the complimentary client connects (the second connection with the same key), we add
	the second connection details into the WorkerInfo object and the main thread starts a new thread with this WorkerInfo object passed into it.
	This new thread handles the data transfer, seperate from the main thread. 

	How the worker thread works:
	- tells the uploader "hey man send your data"
	- receives the data from the uploader
	- directly sends this data to the downloader

Client OverviewL:
	Nothing complicated, if its an uploader it'll tell that to the server, wait until the server responds telling it to upload data, it'll read in 
	the data from the file specified, send the data and then close the connection.
	If its a downloader, it'll tell that to the server, and then wait until the stream of data starts coming in which it then writes to the 
	file thats been specified.
